<div>{{{ WHY WE NEED YOU }}}</div>

<div>{{{ The Folding@home software allows you to share your unused computer power with us – so that we can research even more potential cures. }}}</div>
<div>{{{ FOLDING? }}}</div>
<div>{{{ Folding refers to the way human protein folds in the cells that make up your body. We rely on the proteins to keep us healthy and they assemble themselves by folding. But when they misfold, there can be serious consequences to a person's health. }}}</div>
